## üîç What is A*?

A* (pronounced "A-star") is an informed search algorithm widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It efficiently plots a traversable path between multiple nodes by maintaining a priority queue of paths and choosing the lowest-cost path to expand.


üîÅ How Algorithm work

    üîπ Initialize:

        openList: contains nodes yet to be evaluated (starts with start node).

        closedList: stores nodes already evaluated (starts empty).

        Set start.g = 0: cost from start to start.

        Set start.h = heuristic(start, goal): estimated cost from start to goal.

        Compute start.f = start.g + start.h.

        Set start.parent = null: no parent yet.

    üîπ Main loop: While openList is not empty:

        Select current as the node in openList with the lowest f value (best candidate).

        Goal check:

            If current == goal, return the reconstructed path using reconstruct_path(current).

        Move current node:

            Remove current from openList.

            Add current to closedList.

        Process neighbors:

            For each neighbor of current:

                Skip if the neighbor is already in closedList.

                Compute tentative_g = current.g + distance(current, neighbor).

                If neighbor is not in openList:

                    Add it to openList.

                Else if a better path isn't found:

                    If tentative_g >= neighbor.g, skip (existing path is better).

                Otherwise (this path is better):

                    Update neighbor.parent = current to trace the path later.

                    Update neighbor.g = tentative_g.

                    Update neighbor.h = heuristic(neighbor, goal).

                    Recompute neighbor.f = neighbor.g + neighbor.h.

    ‚ùå If loop ends with no path found:

        Return failure: no path exists between start and goal.

üîÑ Path Reconstruction Function: reconstruct_path(current)

    Start from current (which is the goal node).

    Trace back using parent links, adding each node to a list.

    Stop when current is null (reached the start).

    Return the path in reverse (from start to goal).

# Modules

## 1- Priority queue

## üîç Overview

This repository provides a complete **min-priority queue** implementation in MIPS assembly language, based on a binary heap data structure. It is designed to be used in algorithmic problems like A\* search and Dijkstra's algorithm, where fast retrieval and insertion based on priority are crucial.

## ‚ú® Features

* ‚ö° **Efficient Runtime**: `O(log n)` complexity for `push` and `pop` operations
* üîÑ **Heap-Based Min-Priority Queue**: Ensures minimal `fScore` node stays at root
* üß† **Each Node Contains**:

  * `(x, y)` coordinates
  * `parent` node reference
  * `fScore` (priority metric)
* üñ•Ô∏è **Debugging Utilities**: `print_heap` and `print_EX_node` functions
* üîç **Node Lookup**: `find_node` enables searching nodes by coordinates

## üîß Implementation Details

### Heap Structure

Nodes are arranged in a binary heap using a linear array. Each node occupies **16 bytes**:

```
Offset  Field     Size (bytes)
0       x         4
4       y         4
8       parent    4
12      fScore    4
```

This structure ensures the smallest `fScore` node is always at index `0`, with child nodes following the binary heap rule.

### Binary Heap Properties

* Left child index: `2*i + 1`
* Right child index: `2*i + 2`
* Parent index: `(i - 1) / 2`

Heap operations like bubbling up/down are implemented to maintain this structure.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Include required assembly files:

```assembly
.include "data_pq.asm"
.include "pq_functions.asm"
```

2. Use the API:

```assembly
# Push a node into the priority queue
li $a0, 5          # x
li $a1, 10         # y
li $a2, 0          # parent
li $a3, 15         # fScore
jal push

# Pop the node with the lowest fScore
jal pop
jal print_EX_node  # Display the extracted node
```

## üìö Functions Explained

### `push`

Inserts a node into the priority queue.

#### Inputs:

* `$a0` = x coordinate
* `$a1` = y coordinate
* `$a2` = parent reference
* `$a3` = fScore

#### Steps:

1. Check if the heap is full.
2. Store the new node at the end of the heap.
3. Increment `heapSize`.
4. Perform **bubble-up** to restore min-heap property:

   * Swap with parent until the `fScore` is greater than or equal to the parent's.

### `pop`

Removes and returns the node with the lowest `fScore`.

#### Returns:

* Stores the extracted node in the `extracted_node` memory location.

#### Steps:

1. If the heap is empty, print a message and exit.
2. Copy the root node to `extracted_node`.
3. Move the last element to root.
4. Decrement `heapSize`.
5. Perform **bubble-down**:

   * Compare the current node with its children.
   * Swap with the smaller child until heap property is restored.

### `print_heap`

Prints all nodes in the heap for visualization and debugging.

### `print_EX_node`

Displays the last extracted node after a `pop` operation.

### `find_node`

Finds a node in the heap by coordinates.

#### Inputs:

* `$a0` = x coordinate
* `$a1` = y coordinate

#### Output:

* `$v0` = address of node if found; 0 if not found

#### Process:

* Iterates through the heap and compares stored x and y values with input.

## üìä Performance

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `push`    | O(log n)        |
| `pop`     | O(log n)        |
| `peek`    | O(1)            |

## 2- Node list

### Node Structure
Each node in the grid has the following properties stored in memory:
```
Node {
    int x;           // X coordinate in grid
    int y;           // Y coordinate in grid
    int wall;        // 1 if wall/obstacle, 0 if traversable
    int gScore;      // Cost from start to this node
    int hScore;      // Heuristic estimate from this node to goal
    int fScore;      // gScore + hScore (total estimated cost)
    int parent_x;    // X coordinate of parent node in path
    int parent_y;    // Y coordinate of parent node in path
}
```

The implementation uses a fixed-size array `nodes` to store all nodes in the grid. The node's position in memory is calculated based on its coordinates.

## üß† Core Methods Analysis

### `initialize_nodes`
```assembly
initialize_nodes:
    # Function setup and register saving
    addi    $sp, $sp, -4
    sw      $ra, 0($sp)
    
    # Initialize variables and pointers
    jal     clearScreen
    la      $s0, nodes                # Base node address
    la      $s1, map_data             # Map data pointer
    lw      $s2, map_width            # Grid dimensions
    lw      $s3, map_height
    
    # Main nested loops to process each cell
    li      $s4, 0                    # Row counter (y)
row_loop:
    beq     $s4, $s3, _done           # If row counter equals row count, exit loop
    li      $s5, 0                    # Column counter (x)

col_loop:
    beq     $s5, $s2, next_row        # If column counter equals column count, go to next row

    # Calculate memory addresses
    # ...address calculations...
    
    # Initialize node properties
    sw      $s5, x($t2)               # Store Column index in node
    sw      $s4, y($t2)               # Store row index in node
    lw      $t5, 0($t1)               # Get map value
    sw      $t5, wall($t2)            # Store wall status in node
    
    # A* specific initializations
    li      $t6, 999
    sw      $t6, gScore($t2)          # Initialize gScore to 999 (infinity)
    li      $t6, 0
    sw      $t6, hScore($t2)          # Initialize hScore
    add     $t6, $t6, $t6
    sw      $t6, fScore($t2)          # Initialize fScore
    li      $t6, 0
    sw      $t6, parent_x($t2)        # Initialize parent coordinates
    sw      $t6, parent_y($t2)
    
    # Visualization
    move    $a0, $s5                  # x coordinate
    move    $a1, $s4                  # y coordinate
    move    $a2, $t5                  # node type (wall or not)
    jal     drawGridNode              # Draw node on screen
    
    # Continue loop
    addi    $s5, $s5, 1               # Next column
    lw      $t7, nodes_count
    addi    $t7, $t7, 1
    sw      $t7, nodes_count
    j       col_loop

next_row:
    addi    $s4, $s4, 1               # Increment row counter
    j       row_loop

_done:
    lw      $ra, 0($sp)               # Restore return address
    addi    $sp, $sp, 4               # Restore stack pointer
    jr      $ra
```

This procedure:
1. Sets up a 2D grid representation based on map data
2. Initializes each node with default A* algorithm values
3. Renders the initial grid state visually
4. Uses nested loops for efficient grid traversal

### Score Management Functions

#### `set_g_score` and `get_g_score`
```assembly
# Sets the g-score (cost from start) for a node at (x,y)
set_g_score:
    # Calculate node address from x,y coordinates
    lw      $t0, map_width
    mul     $t1, $a1, $t0             # t1 = y * width
    add     $t1, $t1, $a0             # t1 = y * width + x
    lw      $t2, node_size
    mul     $t3, $t1, $t2             # t3 = index * node_size
    la      $t4, nodes
    add     $t4, $t4, $t3             # t4 = &nodes[index]
    
    # Update the gScore field
    sw      $a2, gScore($t4)          # Store the new gScore value
    jr      $ra

# Gets the g-score for a node at (x,y)
get_g_score:
    # Similar address calculation as set_g_score
    # ...address calculations...
    
    # Retrieve the gScore
    lw      $v0, gScore($t4)          # Load the gScore value
    jr      $ra
```

These functions handle the critical g-score component of A*, representing the actual cost from the start node. Similar patterns are implemented for f-score.

### Path Construction

```assembly
constructPathProcedure:
    # Function setup
    addi    $sp, $sp, -4
    sw      $ra, 0($sp)
    
    # Check if we've reached the start node (base case)
    lw      $s0, start_x
    lw      $s1, start_y
    bne     $a0, $s0, constructPath_next_parent
    bne     $a1, $s1, constructPath_next_parent
    
    # If at start node, return
    lw      $ra, 0($sp)
    addi    $sp, $sp, 4
    jr      $ra
    
constructPath_next_parent:
    # Save current coordinates
    move    $s6, $a0
    move    $s7, $a1
    
    # Find parent node
    # ...address calculations...
    lw      $t3, parent_x($t0)        # Load parent coordinates
    lw      $t4, parent_y($t0)
    
    # Recursive call to process parent node first
    move    $a0, $t3                  # Set parent coordinates as arguments
    move    $a1, $t4
    
    # Save current node coordinates on stack
    addi    $sp, $sp, -8
    sw      $s6, 0($sp)
    sw      $s7, 4($sp)
    
    # Recursive call
    jal     constructPathProcedure
    
    # Restore coordinates
    lw      $s6, 0($sp)
    lw      $s7, 4($sp)
    addi    $sp, $sp, 8
    
    # Visualize this node as part of the path
    move    $a0, $s6
    move    $a1, $s7
    li      $a2, 5                    # Path visualization color/type
    jal     drawGridNode
    
    # Delay for visualization
    li      $v0, 32
    li      $a0, 100
    syscall
    
    # Return
    lw      $ra, 0($sp)
    addi    $sp, $sp, 4
    jr      $ra
```

This procedure recursively constructs and visualizes the path from goal to start by:
1. Checking if we've reached the start node (base case)
2. If not, recursively processing the parent node first (ensuring start-to-goal order)
3. Drawing the node as part of the path after the recursive call returns
4. Using stack to manage recursive calls and preserve registers

## üîç Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Address Calculation Pattern

The code follows a consistent pattern to locate a node in memory:
```assembly
# Calculate node address from coordinates (x,y)
lw      $t0, map_width
mul     $t1, $a1, $t0             # row * width
add     $t1, $t1, $a0             # row * width + column = linear index
lw      $t2, node_size            
mul     $t3, $t1, $t2             # index * node_size = byte offset
la      $t4, nodes                # base address
add     $t4, $t4, $t3             # base + offset = node address
```

This pattern effectively implements the formula: `&nodes[y * width + x]` to convert 2D coordinates to memory addresses.

### Register Usage Strategy

The implementation uses registers strategically:
- `$s0-$s7`: Preserved across function calls, used for important loop variables
- `$t0-$t7`: Temporary values, not preserved across calls
- `$a0-$a3`: Function arguments
- `$v0-$v1`: Function return values
- `$ra`: Return address register, carefully preserved on stack

### Stack Management

The code handles the stack properly for function calls:
```assembly
# Function prologue
addi    $sp, $sp, -4      # Allocate stack space
sw      $ra, 0($sp)       # Save return address

# Function body
# ...

# Function epilogue
lw      $ra, 0($sp)       # Restore return address
addi    $sp, $sp, 4       # Deallocate stack space
jr      $ra               # Return
```

For recursive calls, additional registers are saved:
```assembly
addi    $sp, $sp, -8      # Allocate more space
sw      $s6, 0($sp)       # Save registers
sw      $s7, 4($sp)
```

## üîß Optimization Techniques

1. **Register Usage**: Uses saved registers (`$s0-$s7`) for values needed across function calls
2. **Memory Access**: Calculates addresses efficiently to minimize memory accesses
3. **Code Structure**: Uses jump instructions to avoid redundant condition checks
4. **Data Organization**: Organizes node data for efficient access patterns

## 3- BitMap

## Overview
The module offers rendering functionality for the A* pathfinding visualization, providing essential graphics operations for displaying the grid, nodes, and algorithm progress.

## Data Segment
### Display and Grid Constants

```assembly
.eqv    displayWidth, 16       # Width of the display in units (512 / 32 = 16)
.eqv    displayHeight, 16      # Height of the display in units (512 / 32 = 16)
.eqv    gridCellWidth, 2       # Width of each grid cell in display units
.eqv    gridCellHeight, 2      # Height of each grid cell in display units
.eqv    gridWidth, 8           # Width of the grid in cells
.eqv    gridHeight, 8          # Height of the grid in cells
.eqv    bitmapBaseAddress, 0x10040000  # Memory address of the bitmap display
```

These constants define the dimensions and properties of both the display and the grid:
- `displayWidth` and `displayHeight`: Define the total dimensions of the bitmap display (16√ó16 units)
- `gridCellWidth` and `gridCellHeight`: Define the size of each grid cell (2√ó2 display units)
- `gridWidth` and `gridHeight`: Define the dimensions of the grid itself (8√ó8 cells)
- `bitmapBaseAddress`: The memory address where the bitmap display begins in MIPS memory

### Grid Data

This data structure represents the grid map where:
- `0`: Represents a free/passable cell
- `1`: Represents a wall/obstacle

The grid is an 8√ó8 matrix with strategic placement of obstacles to make the pathfinding problem meaningful.

### Color Table

The color table defines a palette of 13 colors (indexed 0-12) that can be used for rendering different elements of the grid. Each color is represented as a 24-bit RGB value.

## (Functions)

### clearScreen

```assembly
clearScreen:
    li      $t0,                bitmapBaseAddress
    li      $t1,                displayWidth
    mul     $t1,                $t1,                displayHeight
    sll     $t1,                $t1,                2
    add     $t1,                $t1,                bitmapBaseAddress
    li      $t2,                0x808080           # Gray color
clearLoop:
    sw      $t2,                0($t0)
    addi    $t0,                $t0,                4
    blt     $t0,                $t1,                clearLoop
    
    #delay
    li $a0, 20        # 20 milliseconds delay
    li $v0, 32        # syscall for sleep
    syscall

    jr      $ra
```

**Purpose:** Clears the entire bitmap display by filling it with a uniform gray color.

**Steps:**
1. Sets `$t0` to the base address of the bitmap
2. Calculates the total display size in bytes: width √ó height √ó 4 (each pixel is 4 bytes)
3. Sets `$t1` to point just beyond the last displayable pixel
4. Sets each pixel to the gray color (0x808080)
5. Adds a brief delay (20ms) for visual smoothness
6. Returns to the caller

### drawGrid

```assembly
# $a0 = base address, $a1 = free space color, $a2 = wall color
drawGrid:
    li      $s0,                0
    move    $s2,                $a0
outer_loop:
    bge     $s0,                gridHeight,         drawGridEnd
    li      $s1,                0
inner_loop:
    bge     $s1,                gridWidth,          outer_loop_next
    mul     $t0,                $s0,                gridWidth
    add     $t0,                $t0,                $s1
    sll     $t0,                $t0,                2
    add     $t0,                $t0,                $s2
    lw      $a2,                0($t0)
    move    $a0,                $s1
    move    $a1,                $s0
    addi    $sp,                $sp,                -4
    sw      $ra,                0($sp)
    jal     drawGridNode

    #delay
    li $a0, 10        # 10 milliseconds delay
    li $v0, 32        # syscall for sleep
    syscall

    addi    $s1,                $s1,                1
    j       inner_loop
outer_loop_next:
    addi    $s0,                $s0,                1
    j       outer_loop
drawGridEnd:
    lw      $ra,                0($sp)
    addi    $sp,                $sp,                4
    jr      $ra
```

**Purpose:** Renders the entire grid on the bitmap display, differentiating between passable cells and walls.

**Parameters:**
- `$a0`: Base address of the grid data
- `$a1`: Color index for free/passable cells
- `$a2`: Color index for wall/obstacle cells

**Steps:**
1. Uses nested loops to iterate through each cell in the grid (y in outer loop, x in inner loop)
2. Calculates the memory offset for the current grid cell
3. Loads the cell value (0 for free space, 1 for wall)
4. Uses this value as the color index for drawing the grid node
5. Adds a brief delay (10ms) between drawing each node for visual effect
6. Returns to caller after drawing the entire grid

## Integration with A* Algorithm

The bitmap helper module integrates with the A* pathfinding algorithm to visualize:

1. **The Grid**: Shows the layout of passable areas and obstacles
2. **Current Node**: Highlights the node currently being explored (typically in yellow)
3. **Open Set**: Shows nodes in the frontier (typically in gray)
4. **Closed Set**: Shows already explored nodes
5. **Final Path**: Once found, highlights the path from start to goal (typically in green)

The visualization is enhanced with strategic delays to make the algorithm's progress visible and comprehensible to human observers.

## Color Code Usage

The implementation uses various colors to represent different elements:
- **Color 0** (White): Background/free space
- **Color 1** (Black): Walls/obstacles
- **Color 2** (Green): Goal node and final path
- **Color 5** (Yellow): Current node being explored
- **Color 8** (Cyan): Start node
- **Color 9** (Gray): Nodes in the open set/frontier

This color coding makes it easy to distinguish between different elements of the visualization and understand the algorithm's progress.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Display Buffer**: Direct memory access to the bitmap display provides efficient rendering
2. **Strategic Delays**: Small delays are added to make the visualization comprehensible
3. **Pixel-perfect Rendering**: Each grid cell consists of multiple pixels for better visibility
4. **Boundary Checking**: The drawPixel function includes bounds checking to prevent memory access violations

## Data Structures
### Movement Directions

The program defines two sets of movement directions:
```assembly
# Movement directions (4-way: up, right, down, left)
d4x:                .word       0, 1, 0, -1
d4y:                .word       -1, 0, 1, 0

# Or 8-way movement (includes diagonals)
d8x:                .word       0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1
d8y:                .word       -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1
```

- `d4x` and `d4y`: Define 4-way movement (cardinal directions)
- `d8x` and `d8y`: Define 8-way movement (including diagonals)

The program primarily uses 4-way movement for its pathfinding, though 8-way movement is defined and could be used with minor modifications.

### Node Structure

Each node in the grid is represented by a data structure with the following attributes:

```assembly
.eqv        x, 0          # x-coordinate (offset 0)
.eqv        y, 4          # y-coordinate (offset 4)
.eqv        wall, 8       # wall status (offset 8)
.eqv        gScore, 12    # cost from start (offset 12)
.eqv        hScore, 16    # heuristic cost to goal (offset 16)
.eqv        fScore, 20    # total cost (g + h) (offset 20)
.eqv        parent_x, 24  # parent node x-coordinate (offset 24)
.eqv        parent_y, 28  # parent node y-coordinate (offset 28)
```

This structure enables tracking of all necessary information for the A* algorithm, including:
- Position in the grid
- Whether the position is a wall/obstacle
- Path costs (g, h, and f scores)
- Parent node for path reconstruction

## Main Components

### Main Function

The `main` function initializes the program by:
1. Setting up the stack pointer
2. Clearing the screen
3. Drawing the grid
4. Highlighting the start and goal positions
5. Adding a brief delay
6. Calling the A* algorithm implementation

### A* Algorithm Implementation

The A* algorithm is implemented in the `a_star` function, which follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Calls `initialize_nodes` to set up the node data structures
   - Adds the starting node to the open set with a g-score of 0
   - Calculates the h-score (Manhattan distance to the goal)
   - Calculates the f-score (g-score + h-score)
   - Pushes the start node to the open set (priority queue)

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Continues until the open set is empty or the goal is found
   - Pops the node with the lowest f-score from the open set
   - Checks if the popped node is the goal
   - If not, adds the node to the closed set and processes its neighbors

3. **Neighbor Processing**:
   - For each neighbor in the 4 cardinal directions:
     - Calculates its coordinates
     - Checks if it's a valid position (within bounds and not an obstacle)
     - Checks if it's already in the closed set
     - Calculates a tentative g-score
     - Updates the g-score if the tentative score is better
     - Calculates the h-score and f-score
     - Stores the node's parent for path reconstruction
     - Pushes the neighbor to the open set

4. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - If a path is found, it traces back from the goal to the start using parent pointers
   - Visualizes the final path on the grid

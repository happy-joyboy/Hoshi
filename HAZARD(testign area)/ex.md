## üß† A* Algorithm: Core Concepts and Implementation

### What is A*?

A* (pronounced "A-star") is an informed search algorithm widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It efficiently plots a traversable path between multiple nodes by maintaining a priority queue of paths and choosing the lowest-cost path to expand.

### Algorithm Overview

The A* algorithm is built on three key components:
1. **g-score**: The actual cost from the start node to the current node
2. **h-score**: A heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal
3. **f-score**: The sum of g-score and h-score, representing the total estimated cost

The algorithm maintains two sets:
- **Open Set**: Nodes to be evaluated (stored in a priority queue)
- **Closed Set**: Nodes already evaluated

### Algorithm Pseudocode

```
1. Initialize:
   ‚Ä¢ Open List: Contains nodes yet to be evaluated (start with start node)
   ‚Ä¢ Closed List: Stores nodes already evaluated (starts empty)
   ‚Ä¢ Set start.g = 0: Cost from start to start
   ‚Ä¢ Set start.h = heuristic(start, goal): Estimated cost from start to goal
   ‚Ä¢ Compute start.f = start.g + start.h
   ‚Ä¢ Set start.parent = null: No parent yet

2. Main loop: While open list is not empty:
   ‚Ä¢ Select current as the node in openList with the lowest f value
   ‚Ä¢ Goal check:
     ¬∞ If current == goal, return the reconstructed path
   ‚Ä¢ Move current node:
     ¬∞ Remove current from openList
     ¬∞ Add current to closedList
   ‚Ä¢ Process neighbors:
     ¬∞ For each neighbor of current:
       ‚ñ™ Skip if neighbor is in closedList
       ‚ñ™ Compute tentative_g = current.g + distance(current, neighbor)
       ‚ñ™ If neighbor is not in openList: Add it
       ‚ñ™ Else if tentative_g >= neighbor.g: Skip (existing path is better)
       ‚ñ™ Otherwise (this path is better):
         ‚ñ´ Update neighbor.parent = current
         ‚ñ´ Update neighbor.g = tentative_g
         ‚ñ´ Update neighbor.h = heuristic(neighbor, goal)
         ‚ñ´ Recompute neighbor.f = neighbor.g + neighbor.h

3. If loop ends with no path found:
   ‚Ä¢ Return failure: No path exists between start and goal

4. Path Reconstruction Function:
   ‚Ä¢ Start from goal node
   ‚Ä¢ Trace back using parent links, adding each node to a path
   ‚Ä¢ Return the path in reverse (from start to goal)
```

### Core psudo Implementation 

The A* algorithm is implemented in the `a_star` function, which follows the pseudocode above:

function A_Star(start, goal):
    // Initialize open and closed lists
    openList = [start]          // Nodes to be evaluated
    closedList = []            // Nodes already evaluated
    
    // Initialize node properties
    start.g = 0                // Cost from start to start is 0
    start.h = heuristic(start, goal)  // Estimate to goal
    start.f = start.g + start.h       // Total estimated cost
    start.parent = null              // For path reconstruction
    while openList is not empty:
        // Get node with lowest f value - implement using a priority queue
       // for faster retrieval of the best node
        current = node in openList with lowest f value
        
        // Check if we've reached the goal
        if current = goal:
            return reconstruct_path(current)
            
        // Move current node from open to closed list
        remove current from openList
        add current to closedList
        
        // Check all neighboring nodes
        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor in closedList:
                continue  // Skip already evaluated nodes
                
            // Calculate tentative g score
            tentative_g = current.g + distance(current, neighbor)
            
            if neighbor not in openList:
                add neighbor to openList
            else if tentative_g >= neighbor.g:
                continue  // This path is not better
                
            // This path is the best so far
            neighbor.parent = current
            neighbor.g = tentative_g
            neighbor.h = heuristic(neighbor, goal)
            neighbor.f = neighbor.g + neighbor.h
    
    return failure  // No path exists
function reconstruct_path(current):
    path = []
    while current is not null:
        add current to beginning of path
        current = current.parent
    return path

## üìä Data Structures and Modules

The implementation is organized into several modules, each handling specific aspects of the algorithm:

### 1. Priority Queue

The priority queue is implemented as a binary min-heap, which ensures efficient extraction of the node with the lowest f-score.

#### Node Structure in the Priority Queue
```
Offset  Field     Size (bytes)
0       x         4
4       y         4
8       parent    4
12      fScore    4
```

#### Key Operations:
- **push**: Inserts a node with O(log n) complexity
- **pop**: Extracts the node with lowest f-score with O(log n) complexity

### 2. Node List

Each node in the grid has specific properties that track its state in the A* algorithm.

#### Node Structure
```
Offset  Field     Size (bytes)
0       x         4
4       y         4
8       wall      4
12      gScore    4
16      hScore    4
20      fScore    4
24      parent_x  4
28      parent_y  4
```

#### Key Operations:
- **initialize_nodes**: Sets up the grid based on map data
- **set_g_score/get_g_score**: Manages cost from start
- **set_f_score/get_f_score**: Manages total estimated cost


### 3. Bitmap Display

The bitmap module manages visualization, providing a graphical representation of the A* algorithm's execution.

#### Display Constants
```assembly
.eqv    displayWidth, 16       # Width of the display in units
.eqv    displayHeight, 16      # Height of the display in units
.eqv    gridCellWidth, 2       # Width of each grid cell
.eqv    gridCellHeight, 2      # Height of each grid cell
.eqv    gridWidth, 8           # Width of the grid in cells
.eqv    gridHeight, 8          # Height of the grid in cells
.eqv    bitmapBaseAddress, 0x10040000  # Memory address of bitmap
```

#### Key Operations:
- **clearScreen**: Initializes the display
- **drawGridNode**: Renders a single node with specific color based on its state
- **drawGrid**: Renders the entire grid

### 4. Heuristic Functions

The A* algorithm uses heuristic functions to estimate the cost from any node to the goal.

#### Available Heuristics:
- **Manhattan Distance**: Sum of horizontal and vertical distances
- **Chebyshev Distance**: Maximum of horizontal and vertical distances

```assembly
manhattanDistance:
    # Calculate |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|
    sub     $t0, $a0, $a2      # x1-x2
    abs     $t0, $t0           # |x1-x2|
    
    sub     $t1, $a1, $a3      # y1-y2
    abs     $t1, $t1           # |y1-y2|
    
    add     $v0, $t0, $t1      # |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|
    jr      $ra

chebyshevDistance:
    # Calculate max(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|)
    sub     $t0, $a0, $a2      # x1-x2
    abs     $t0, $t0           # |x1-x2|
    
    sub     $t1, $a1, $a3      # y1-y2
    abs     $t1, $t1           # |y1-y2|
    
    # Find maximum
    bge     $t0, $t1, max_is_x
    move    $v0, $t1
    j       chebyshev_return
    
max_is_x:
    move    $v0, $t0
    
chebyshev_return:
    jr      $ra
```

### 5. Path Reconstruction

Once the A* algorithm finds a path, it traces back from the goal to the start using parent pointers.


## üîç Implementation Details

### Memory Management

The implementation uses a consistent pattern to locate nodes in memory:

```assembly
# Calculate node address from (x,y) coordinates
lw      $t0, map_width        # Load grid width
mul     $t1, $a1, $t0         # t1 = y * width
add     $t1, $t1, $a0         # t1 = y * width + x
lw      $t2, node_size        # Load node size in bytes
mul     $t3, $t1, $t2         # t3 = index * node_size
la      $t4, nodes            # Load base address
add     $t4, $t4, $t3         # t4 = base + offset
```

This efficiently implements the formula: `&nodes[y * width + x]` to convert 2D coordinates to memory addresses.

### Register Usage Strategy

The implementation follows a consistent register allocation strategy:
- `$s0-$s7`: Preserved across function calls, used for loop variables and important data
- `$t0-$t9`: Temporary calculations, not preserved across calls
- `$a0-$a3`: Function arguments
- `$v0-$v1`: Function return values
- `$ra`: Return address register, preserved on stack when making nested calls

### Stack Management

Proper stack management is critical for function calls and recursion:

```assembly
# Function prologue
addi    $sp, $sp, -4      # Allocate stack space
sw      $ra, 0($sp)       # Save return address

# Function body
# ...

# Function epilogue
lw      $ra, 0($sp)       # Restore return address
addi    $sp, $sp, 4       # Deallocate stack space
jr      $ra               # Return
```

## üé® Visualization

The visualization uses a consistent color scheme:
- **Color 0** (White): Background/free space
- **Color 1** (Black): Walls/obstacles
- **Color 2** (Green): Goal node
- **Color 3** (Green): Final path
- **Color 5** (Yellow): Current node being explored
- **Color 8** (Cyan): Start node
- **Color 9** (Gray): Nodes in the open set

This color coding makes it easy to understand the algorithm's progress visually.

## üîß Optimization Techniques

1. **Priority Queue**: O(log n) operations for managing the open set
2. **Register Usage**: Strategic register allocation minimizes memory access
3. **Closed Set**: Efficient tracking of evaluated nodes
4. **Memory Access**: Calculates addresses efficiently to minimize overhead
5. **Data Organization**: Node structures organized for efficient access patterns

## üìä Performance Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|
| Node Extraction | O(log n) |
| Node Insertion | O(log n) |
| Path Reconstruction | O(p) where p is path length |
| Heuristic Calculation | O(1) |
| Overall Algorithm | O(E log V) where V is number of nodes and E is number of edges |

## üîÑ Movement Directions

The implementation supports both 4-way and 8-way movement:

```assembly
# 4-way movement (up, right, down, left)
d4x:                .word       0, 1, 0, -1
d4y:                .word       -1, 0, 1, 0

# 8-way movement (includes diagonals)
d8x:                .word       0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1
d8y:                .word       -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1
```

The default implementation uses 4-way movement for simplicity and clarity.

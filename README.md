## 📝 Overview

**Hoshi** (星, Japanese for "star") is a complete implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in MIPS assembly language. This project demonstrates low-level programming concepts by implementing a complex algorithmic solution in assembly language, offering valuable insights into computer architecture and optimization techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- **✅ Complete A* algorithm implementation** in pure MIPS assembly
- **✅ Priority Queue** with efficient insertion and extraction operations
- **✅ Manhattan Distance Heuristic** for optimal path calculation
- **✅ Visual Representation** through bitmap display for step-by-step algorithm progression
- **✅ Obstacle Detection** with robust path planning around barriers
- **✅ Path Reconstruction** with visual highlighting of the optimal route

## 🔍 What is A*?

A* (pronounced "A-star") is an informed search algorithm widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It efficiently plots a traversable path between multiple nodes by maintaining a priority queue of paths and choosing the lowest-cost path to expand.

### Core Components

1. **`g(n)`**: Cost from the start node to the current node
2. **`h(n)`**: Estimated cost from current node to goal (heuristic)
3. **`f(n)`**: Total cost, where `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`

A* guarantees an optimal solution (shortest path) when using an admissible heuristic that never overestimates the actual cost.

## 🖥️ Implementation Details

### Data Structures

- **Node Structure**: 32 bytes per node containing:
  - Position (x, y)
  - Wall status
  - g-score, h-score, f-score 
  - Parent node reference

- **Priority Queue**: Binary heap implementation for efficient node retrieval
  - O(log n) insertion and extraction operations
  - Stores nodes by f-score for optimal path selection

- **Grid Representation**: 8x8 grid with obstacles (1) and free space (0)

### Algorithm Flow

1. **Initialization**: Create start node, calculate heuristic, add to open set
2. **Main Loop**: Until goal is found or open set is empty
   - Extract node with lowest f-score
   - Check if goal is reached
   - Add current node to closed set
   - Process valid neighbors
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Trace parent nodes from goal to start

### Visualization System

The bitmap display provides real-time visualization of:
- ⬜ Free cells and ⬛ obstacles
- 🟡 Currently processed nodes
- 🟢 Start position
- 🟣 Goal position
- 🔴 Final path

# ðŸŒŸ Hoshi: A* Algorithm in MIPS Assembly  

Welcome to **Hoshi**, a project dedicated to implementing the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm in MIPS assembly language.  

---

## ðŸš€ About the Project

**Hoshi** aims to demonstrate how high-level algorithmic logic can be adapted to a low-level environment.  
The A* algorithm is widely used in game development, robotics, GPS systems, and AI due to its balance between performance and accuracy.  
Implementing it in **MIPS** presents an exciting challenge and a great learning opportunity for computer architecture and embedded systems enthusiasts.

## What is A*?  
A* is a popular and efficient pathfinding algorithm used in various applications such as games, robotics, and navigation systems. It combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search by using a cost function to find the shortest path between two points.  

### Key Components of A*  
1. **Priority Queue**: Manages nodes based on their cost, ensuring the most promising node is processed first.  
2. **Cost Function**: Combines the actual cost from the start node to the current node (`g(n)`) and the estimated cost to the goal (`h(n)`).  
3. **A* Implementation**: The core logic that iteratively selects the best path until the goal is reached.  
4. **GUI Using Bitmap**: A visual representation of the algorithm's progress and results.  

## TODO List  
- [x] Priority Queue  
- [ ] Cost Function  
- [ ] A* Implementation  
- [ ] GUI Using Bitmap
